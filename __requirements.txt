Personal Assignment

This project is for you to create a personal web page about yourself.  You are selling yourself through how you can design a complete web site by using your mad skilz.  The main purpose of this web site is for you to present to future employers the work you can do.  This will be a public facing web page and will be required to be built without using commercial tools or publicly available templates.

You are to create a personal page about what you like to eat.  You are to pretend you are a restaurant owner that applies to your favorite hobby.  You are to describe your restaurant, the location, and the menu of the items you serve.  You should describe yourself (whether true or not) as the owner of the company and who you have employed.  Customers should be able to complete a survey about their experience at your restaurant.  The results should be displayed only as a logged in user.

The web site needs at least 15 main pages with some available to a non-logged in user and at least 5 available to a logged in user.  The logged in user should be able to change the prices of the menu items, add items, and delete items from the menu.  You will need to create a login for 'investor' with a password of 'T3ach123'.  This account will be used for me to test the website as a logged in user.
